## **1.    Introduction**

The goal of this project was to create a taskboard that would allow a user to add a task. In clicking the "Add Task"  button on the change, the user would be prompted with a form to add in the task title, due date (which can be selected using a date picker rather than requiring the manual input of a date), and a description of the task. 

The task will auto-populate into the "To Do" field, but the user will then have the ability to drag the task to any of the other columns if it is in Progress or completed/Done. Based on the due date of the task, it will update the color of the task item to indicate whether the deadline is today (yellow) or if it has past the due date (red). If the user desires, they will also have the ability to delete tasks at will, whether they are completed or no longer needed.
